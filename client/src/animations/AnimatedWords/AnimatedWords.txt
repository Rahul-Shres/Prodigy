Certainly, let's break down the TypeScript code for the `AnimatedWords` component step by step:

1. **Imports:**
   ```typescript
   import { motion } from "framer-motion";
   import { useEffect } from "react";
   import { useAnimation } from "framer-motion";
   import { useInView } from "react-intersection-observer";
   ```
   - These are the same imports we discussed earlier: `motion` from "framer-motion", `useEffect` from "react", `useAnimation` from "framer-motion", and `useInView` from "react-intersection-observer". These imports are necessary for animations, side effects, and intersection observer functionality.

2. **Type Definition:**
   ```typescript
   type AnimatedWordsProps = {
       title: string;
       style: string;
   };
   ```
   - This defines the `AnimatedWordsProps` type, which specifies that the component expects `title` and `style` props, both of which should be strings.

3. **Component Definition:**
   ```typescript
   const AnimatedWords: React.FC<AnimatedWordsProps> = ({ title, style }) => {
       // Custom hooks and animation logic here
       return (
           // JSX content for the animated words
       );
   };
   ```
   - This defines the `AnimatedWords` functional component, which takes props of type `AnimatedWordsProps`. Inside the component, there is logic for animations and rendering JSX content.

4. **Custom Hooks and Animation Logic:**
   ```typescript
   const ctrls = useAnimation();
   const { ref, inView } = useInView({
       threshold: 0.1,
       triggerOnce: true,
   });
   useEffect(() => {
       if (inView) {
           ctrls.start("animate");
       }
       if (!inView) {
           ctrls.start("initial");
       }
   }, [ctrls, inView]);
   ```
   - `ctrls = useAnimation();`: This line uses the `useAnimation` hook from Framer Motion to create animation controls.
   - `{ ref, inView } = useInView({ threshold: 0.1, triggerOnce: true });`: This line uses the `useInView` hook from "react-intersection-observer" to detect when the component is in the viewport (`inView`).
   - `useEffect`: This hook is used to trigger animations based on whether the component is in view (`inView`). When the component enters the viewport, it starts the animation defined by `ctrls.start("animate")`, and when it exits, it goes back to the initial state defined by `ctrls.start("initial")`.

5. **Animation Variants:**
   ```typescript
   const wordAnimation = {
       initial: {
           opacity: 0,
           y: 150,
       },
       animate: {
           opacity: 1,
           y: 0,
           transition: {
               delay: 6,
               ease: [0.2, 0.65, 0.3, 0.9],
               duration: 1,
           },
       },
   };
   ```
   - `wordAnimation`: This object defines animation variants for individual words in the `title`. It specifies initial and animate states along with transition properties such as delay, ease, and duration.

6. **JSX Content:**
   ```typescript
   return (
       <h1 aria-label={title} role="heading">
           <motion.span ref={ref} className="...">
               {title.split(" ").map((word, index) => (
                   <motion.div
                       key={index}
                       initial="initial"
                       animate={ctrls}
                       transition={{ delayChildren: index * 0.25, staggerChildren: 0.05 }}
                       className="..."
                   >
                       <motion.span className={style} variants={wordAnimation}>
                           {word + "\u00A0"}
                       </motion.span>
                   </motion.div>
               ))}
           </motion.span>
       </h1>
   );
   ```
   - This JSX code renders a heading (`<h1>`) with a motion span (`<motion.span>`) inside. The `ref` is used for intersection observer functionality. Inside the span, each word from the `title` prop is split and mapped to a motion div (`<motion.div>`), where each word is wrapped in a motion span (`<motion.span>`). These elements are animated based on the `ctrls` animation controls and the `wordAnimation` variants.

Overall, this code sets up a component (`AnimatedWords`) that animates its content when it becomes visible in the viewport using Framer Motion animations and React hooks like `useEffect` and `useInView`.
